## Spam Classifier Project

### Description

This project aims to create a spam classifier model using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on their content. The project utilizes a dataset of emails, consisting of both spam and ham examples, to train and evaluate the classifier.

### Setup

The project requires Python 3.7 or later and the following libraries:
- `sklearn` (version 1.0.1 or later)
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk`
- `urlextract`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib nltk urlextract
```

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The project first downloads a dataset of spam and ham emails from a public corpus. It then preprocesses the emails, converting them to plain text, and extracts features from the text for machine learning model training.

### Feature Extraction

The feature extraction process involves converting the text into word counts, then transforming these counts into numerical vectors. This step is crucial for training the machine learning model.

### Model Training and Evaluation

The project uses a logistic regression model for classifying emails as spam or ham. The model is trained using the extracted features from the training dataset and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

### Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of over 98.5% on the training set. Precision and recall scores are also calculated on the test set to evaluate the model's performance further.

### Conclusion

The spam classifier project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to classify emails based on their content. The model shows promising results and can be further optimized and extended for real-world spam detection applications.
